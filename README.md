Long Project LP2: Skip List

Files Included
- SkipList.java
- SkipListDriver.java
- Timer.java

Methods
- add(x)      : Add a new element x to the list. If x already exists in the skip list, replace it and return false. Otherwise, insert x into the skip list and return true.
- ceiling(x)  : Find smallest element that is greater or equal to x.
- contains(x) : Does list contain x?
- first()     : Return first element of list.
- floor(x)    : Find largest element that is less than or equal to x.
- get(n)      : Return element at index n of list.  First element is at index 0. Call either getLinear or getLog.
- getLinear(n): O(n) algorithm for get(n).
- getLog(n)   : O(log n) expected time algorithm for get(n). This method is optional, but code it correctly to earn EC.
- isEmpty()   : Is the list empty?
- iterator()  : Iterator for going through the elements of list in sorted order.
- last()      : Return last element of list.
- rebuild()   : Reorganize the elements of the list into a perfect skip list.
- remove(x)   : Remove x from the list. If successful, removed element is returned.  Otherwise, return null.
- size()      : Return the number of elements in the list.
